## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

For the 2020 Microsoft Challenge Project. Utilize the NASA Meteorite, American Meteor Society, International Meteor Organization, and the Radio Meteor Observing Bulletin datasets . The analysis will be conducted using data science tools and libraries to form conclusions about frequency, location, and impact.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

__Visit the live site at: [Project Impact](https://robotgyal.github.io/Project-Impact-2020/)__

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
